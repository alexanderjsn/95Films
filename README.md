( BILD PÅ RESPONSIVENESS )

# # Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

# # # Navigation Bar

The navigation bar is featured on all three pages and is fully responsive. The black font of the menu items
contrasts to the white background, making it more accessible. The navigation bar also contains a logo that links to the homepage and links to each section of the website. 
An underscore appears underneath the active link, to show the user which page they are on. 


# # Main Section

The main section contains an image showcasing the kind of work that the company does. It also contains a big heading with a paragraph underneath that
tells the user what kind of services the company offers and a the company background.


# # The Footer

The footer section includes links to the relevant social media sites for Love Running. The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user.
The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to keep connected via social media

# # Gallery

The gallery includes several images of the company working on films. This gives the company more credibility. 
The images potrays grand moviesets and expensive filmmaking equipment, which also provide value to the user by showcasing what kind of level the company operates on. 


# # The Contct Page

This page will allow the user to reach out to the company to ask any questions or book a consultation.  
The page contains a responsive form which encoourages the user to enter their first and last name, phonenumber and also leave a message. 
The heading and paragraph on the site provides the user with information on the company location and encourages the user to
contact the company or visit the office. 

# # Features Left to Implement
I would like to add a responsive hamburger navigation bar, that only appears on medium to smaller screens. The navigation menu would
cover the page when clicked on and would be easily closed again. This feature would be preferable to the responsive navigation bar that is
currently on the site, as it would provide the site with a more accessible approach. 

# Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. 
Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended,
 with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

# # Validator Testing

# # # CSS

# # # Unfixed Bugs
You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
